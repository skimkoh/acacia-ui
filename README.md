# Acacia UI

Acacia UI is a component system for building products that are consistent & scalable.

## Storybook

Acacia UI is a work-in-progress design system, meant for developers to scale up quickly with customized components for enterprise use. 

Acacia UI wraps around Ant Design, with further capabilities and complex components, using Ant Design's components as the base.

UI components are deployed [here](https://acacia-ui.vercel.app) for testing purposes.

## Roadmap

Features that will be worked on:

- Moving from webpack to Rollup for bundling
- Integration of all Ant Design's components into Acacia UI
- AI-native components meant for AI development
- Responsive layout templates with color token support for theming

## Security
Acacia UI is continuously scanned for vulnerabilities using Aikido Security. This includes dependency vulnerability scanning and static code analysis.

We aim to address identified issues promptly and keep the dependency tree secure for downstream applications.
