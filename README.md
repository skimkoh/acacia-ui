# Acacia UI

Acacia UI is a component system for building products that are consistent & scalable. It is a work-in-progress design system, meant for developers to scale up quickly with customized components for enterprise use. 

It wraps around Ant Design, with further capabilities and complex components, using Ant Design's components as the base.

## Features

- Fully TypeScript
- Storybook for interactive component documentation
- Chromatic integration for visual regression testing
- Automated dependency scanning for security and updates

UI components are deployed on Storybook [here](https://acacia-ui.vercel.app) for testing purposes.
